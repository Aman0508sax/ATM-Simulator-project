    "#1.) Here in this project we starts with importing time module writing import time , it is a in built module of python which works when you want to give a time lapse in something ,so whenever we go to ATM when we insert out ATM card a slight pause of 5 sec comes that can be done by import time module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2.)By default I have given a balance of 2000/- INR but you can give any balance and it works perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3.)At first i print ('Welcome to ABC Bank ATM') it's a welcome note whenever your go to an ATM .\n",
    "\n",
    "#4.)Reason of executing print('********') is just to look the code and display attractive .\n",
    "\n",
    "#5.)when  we insert card it asks for 4 digit pin so for that i ask the user to provide input of their 4 digit pin.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6.)Here I use .isdigit() method of python which  returns True if all the characters are digits, otherwise False.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7.)I provide len(Pin)==4 used len() function here to check the length of pin or number of items and putting it ==4 defines that if pin length is equal to 4 only then it will takes it as true other wise it will deny.\n",
    "\n",
    "#8.)The above point (#7) runs in a if-else statement if pin is equals to 4 it will print (pin is valid) else not .\n",
    "\n",
    "#9.) Now in the same if-else we run a while loop ,which when true : we print basic functionalities (Check Balance,withdraw, deposit , exit) by numbering them and use try and exception blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#10.) try block helps to execute  when there is no error in the program meanwhile exception works When an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#11.) if choosed option is right in the same if - else we run and another if-else called as nested if-else where we pass condition for every option and prints them accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#12.) if you wanna choose option 1 and check your balance print balance in f string .\n",
    "\n",
    "#13.) if you wanna deposit amount so amount that is going to be deposit it will store in a variable in addition to current balance and that variable executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#14.)if you wanna withdraw amount so amount that is going to be withdraw it will store in a variable by subtracting from current balance and that variable executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#15.)In this code I have also mark that if you want transaction receipt or not for that i used if-else statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#16.) last but not the least if you wanna exit print option==4 and exit.\n"
